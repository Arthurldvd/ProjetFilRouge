##frontend
- Use the Composition API exclusively.
- Use Pinia for state management.
- Do not perform API calls directly inside components.

- Controllers must not contain business logic.
- Always use DTOs to validate user input.
- Validate inputs with class-validator.
- Follow RESTful conventions for CRUD endpoints.
- Prepare the code for Swagger auto-generated documentation.

#General

- Follow official NestJS and Vue.js best practices.
- Avoid over-engineering.

## Quality & Testing
- Code must be testable and maintenable
- Avoid unecessary dependecies

##AI Usage 
- The AI acts as assitant, not as an autonomous decision maker.
- When uncertain, ask for clarification insteead of guessing.
